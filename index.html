     What is a Web developer portfolio?
    Image result for portfolio website developer
    For web developers, a personal portfolio page is like a resume.
     Instead of listing your skills on a resume in the traditional way,
      you can prove your competence with a personal portfolio. When people or
      potential employers see your portfolio, they can get a glimpse of your skills. </p>
